# order-calculator
A small JavaScript application where the user picks 3 items from the list of options and the total price displays in the span element after the calculate button is pressed.

- Taken the elements from HTML and converted the strings to numbers by using ParseInt() function to display the correct result.
- Added a function to calculate the choices selected.
- Created a checkbox to add "bags" which cost an extra $5.00 to the total.
